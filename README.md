# Ants

The interface includes visual elements such as the simulation area, food count display, and informational pop-ups.
Layout

    Simulation Area: The central feature is the simulation canvas where ants move, explore, and collect food. It's a large rectangular area occupying most of the screen.
    Food Count Display: At the top left corner, a small overlay shows the number of times ants have successfully brought food back to the colony.
    Information Button: A button labeled "Info" at the top right corner, which, when clicked, displays a modal with a description of the simulation and instructions for interaction.
    Interactivity: Users interact with the simulation by clicking anywhere on the simulation canvas to drop food at that location.
